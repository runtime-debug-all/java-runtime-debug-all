"Doors Into Your Code"
# Core Elements
1) Reflection to gain variable names.
2) Unknown to gain line numbers.
3) Unknown monitor from specified line number.
4) Unknown, how assignment can be monitored.

## Definitions that might be useful for modular build
1) want line numbers where Calling the Function.
2) 
3) 

### Works well with starting out applications.
### Convention can change per program request...
1) mode 1 - default all.
2) mode 2 - default 10, require prompt.
3) mode 3 - temp User Change from default.

## Intended Output:
<b>it should</b> "print line number, var name, and var value"<br><br>
  ```line 10, testB, val 5 || line 11, testB, val 4 || line 10, testB, val 6 || line 11, testB, val 4```
  <br><br>```line 20, testC, val 2 || line 21, testD, val 3```
  <br><br>```line 24, testB, val 2```
<br><br>end
